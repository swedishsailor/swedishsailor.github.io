          <img height="128" width="128" src="img/DRZEWKO.png" /><p> Pixel art is a form of digital art, created through the use of software, where images are edited on the pixel level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphics comes from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as graphing calculators. In most pixel art, the color palette used is extremely limited in size, with some pixel art using only two colors. </p>

You are blind Jack but any eye you've found can be used in certain ways. But... there is one, little, risk... The stronger your eye skill is, the more your soul is infected, which in the worst case leads you to Limbo world, where you have to fight against fallen souls of your opponents instead of their material bodies.</p>
